generates output similar to the sample below
4. Deliver the final code in .java files and any other resources required to run the program
5. Please indicate in comments or in a separate document any assumptions you make about the
requirements, as well as any “ToDo” items that you would do if this was a “real” project but that are
not in the requirements given.
